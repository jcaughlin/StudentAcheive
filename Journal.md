###  Today is February 19th
* pair down user entity in project for review.
* see above
* Catching up with things though between class and internship I am sick to my stomach. I wonder if I will get a big high when I am caught up. It feels good to finish things even though it is as hard if not harder than the last time.

### Today is February 27th
* I am doing a poor job Journaling.
* Where should I document ClipArt royalty information.
* Need to see if Paula will help me with Project Management, so I don't wait so much time NOT WATCHING VIDEOS.
* I need to get more sleep.
* Intership seems to be going okay.
* I am behind, but I am way ahead of last semester although that makes me feel worse as there is no reason I should be behind and I am extremely frustrated that I am and the reasons why. Telling me that I do this to myself doesn't really help me not do this to myself.
